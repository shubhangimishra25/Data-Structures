# Best case time complexity O(n2)
# Worst case time complexity O(n2)

# This is feasible to use in the small lists

# EXAMPLE dry run
# [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
# [4, 3, 1, 2, 5] after swapping  5 3 where 5  is the maximum  and is being placed at the last position
# [4, 3, 1, 2, 5]
# [2, 3, 1, 4, 5] after swapping  4 2 where 4  is the maximum  and is being placed at the last position
# [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
# [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] after swapping  3 1 where 3  is the maximum  and is being placed at the last position
# [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] after swapping  2 1 where 2  is the maximum  and is being placed at the last position
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] after swapping  1 1 where 1  is the maximum  and is being placed at the last position
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
